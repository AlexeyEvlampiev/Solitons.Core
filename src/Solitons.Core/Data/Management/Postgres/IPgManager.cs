/// <summary>
/// Provides functionality for managing a Postgres database, enabling declarative and idempotent database operations.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This interface defines methods for creating, deleting, and testing a Postgres database. It supports the concept of 'Desired State Configuration' wherein the <see cref="CreateDbAsync"/> method ensures the database is set up according to the desired state. This can include creating necessary roles, registering secrets, setting role permissions, populating the database with reference data, and more.
/// The <see cref="DropDbAsync"/> method allows for complete removal of the database, useful in scenarios like DevOps and Integration Tests where databases may need to be provisionally created and then removed.
/// The <see cref="RunTestAsync"/> method encourages a model where the database is treated as software and tests are run to ensure its proper functioning. While this approach may not suit all, the interface provides sufficient flexibility for a wide range of use-cases.

    /// If the database already exists, this method will upgrade it and configure it according to the desired state. 
    /// The primary outcome of this method is the creation or configuration of the database on the server.

    /// <remarks>
    /// These tests aim to validate the correctness of the various functionalities of the database, which may include stored procedures, if they are used. This methodology is rooted in the philosophy that databases can be a robust location for business logic, with other parts of the system acting primarily as middleware or a database client. This perspective is not universally shared, and as such, the actual implementation of tests can and should be adapted to the unique requirements and philosophies of each engineering team and project.

    /// It's a shortcut method that first calls <see cref="DropDbAsync"/> to delete the database and all its associated roles and permissions, and then calls <see cref="CreateDbAsync"/> to recreate the database, set it up according to the desired state, and establish necessary roles and permissions.
